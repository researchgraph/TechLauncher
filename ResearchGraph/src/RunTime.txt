In Kun's MacBook Pro
Processor: 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5
Memory: 8 GB 1867 MHz DDR3

Run:
Publication.java        needs   1h and 59min
Publication2.java       needs   1h and 59min
Grant.java              needs   less than 30s
Researcher.java         needs   about 1min
Dataset.java            needs   less than 1min


I set the program run 10000 queries at one time, it may not be the perfect number, but I tried 100 queries at one time, it became much slower. I guess it is because it costs lots of time to call an ExecutionEngine

But if I don't set a limitation, my computer becomes stuck. The CUP runs over 340%

However, it works well in Andy's computer. But he said it spent more than 10 min to run Researcher.java, but when I add a limitation, I spent only 1 min. So I suggest adding a limitation is a good idea
